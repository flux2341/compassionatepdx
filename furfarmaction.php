With COVID-19 cases once again skyrocketing in Oregon, I want to alert you to an alarming new risk from the fur trade. In April the virus was first detected on a mink farm in the Netherlands, and has since spread to farms throughout Europe, resulting in millions of mink being culled. The virus mutated and was transmitted back to humans, infecting over 200 people, and raising fears it would make any vaccine we developed ineffective. Please take executive action to stop all breeding operations on mink farms in Oregon, and work with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to coordinate a government buy-out program.</textarea>
