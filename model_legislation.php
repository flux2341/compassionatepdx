  <h4>Model Legislation</h4>
  <p>Our model legislation is based on the ban that was passed in San Francisco. It is a city ordinance that prohibits the manufacture and sale of new fur products within city limits: fur coats, coats with fur trim, handbags, shoes, hats, and keychains. You can view the full text <a href="Portland Fur Ban Ordinance Draft.pdf">here</a>.</p>
